  ~ Here we have our single page application file!
  ~ Previous versions of achat used multi-page applications. While that works
  ~ and all, having everything neatly contained in one single page which
  ~ uses a routing system to control what the user is seeing is very helpful.
  ~ Even though it uses up a LOT more RAM (everything must stay loaded at all
  ~ times) this also means that less server resources have to be used for all
  ~ of achat to function as intended.
